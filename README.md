CPP
Welcome to CPP — a collection of exercises dedicated to mastering the C++98 language!

About the Project
This repository is a personal showcase of my learning journey in C++. Here, you’ll find practical exercises and code snippets that explore essential features and concepts of the language, including:

Containers: Dive into STL containers and custom implementations.
Iterators: Understand how to traverse and manipulate data structures.
Polymorphism: Experiment with dynamic behavior and abstract interfaces.
Inheritance: Demonstrate code reuse and object hierarchies.
And more: Discover various aspects of C++98 through hands-on practice.
Whether you’re a fellow learner or just curious about C++, this repo offers a snapshot of the foundational tools and techniques every C++ developer should know.
